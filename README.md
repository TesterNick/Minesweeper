# Minesweeper

This is my version of popular game Minesweeper. It has GUI and requires Tcl/Tk installed on your system
as well as tkinter module in your Python library (included by default in standard package for Windows).
In Linux you may need
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

It is the second version of the program because it has GUI while the first one was completely textual.

The program works on Windows and Linux. Tested on Windows 10, Windows XP, Lubuntu 16.04, and Debian LXDE 9.3.

Now you can play the game on your job even if sysadmins deleted
all the games before you got your computer :)

If you find some typos or bugs please don't hesitate to report them.

The only purpose of all my code here is training, so it is free of charge
and can be used "as is" or modified in any way.
